        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared 
            and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <p><li>4 (8 ounce) beef chuck steaks, well trimmed, at room temperature</li></p>
                <p><li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li></p>
                <p><li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li></p>
                <p><li>3 tablespoons butter, divided, or more as needed</li></p>
                <p><li>2 sprigs fresh thyme (optional)</li></p>
                <p><li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li></p>
                <p><li>1 shallot, minced</li></p>
                <p><li>1/2 cup beef broth</li></p>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <p><li>Pat steaks dry with a paper towel. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li></p>
            <p><li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Place steaks in the hot skillet and immediately turn down the heat to medium-high. Cook for 4 minutes. Turn steaks, add 1 tablespoon butter (or more as desired) and thyme sprigs to the pan, and cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes, depending on your taste. Remove steaks from skillet and let rest, about 5 minutes. </li></p>
            <p><li>Meanwhile, make pan sauce: remove skillet from heat. Quickly saute the garlic and shallot for 1 to 2 minutes in the skillet using residual heat. Return the skillet to medium-low heat and add beef broth. Bring to a boil and reduce for 3 minutes. </li></p>
            <p><li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Serve sauce over steaks.</li></p>
        </ol>
